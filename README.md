__Jump into outer-space to witness the sun bathe one hemisphere of Earth in 
daylight as the sleeping side twinkles with its own artificial lights of 
night.__
Has your child asked what makes day and night? How can it be morning on one 
side of Earth but evening on another? Show them. 
[Day & Night ](https://dayandnight.moar.io "Day & Night (WebVR)") is an 
educational virtual reality experience for children using WebVR to explore how
sunshine creates our most basic unit of time.  

Experience [Day & Night ](https://dayandnight.moar.io "Day & Night (WebVR)")
right now in your WebVR-capable browser: https://dayandnight.moar.io


Requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. [Day & Night ](https://dayandnight.moar.io "Day & Night (WebVR)") supports 
the [HTC Vive](https://www.vive.com/),
[Oculus Rift](https://www.oculus.com/rift/),
[Google Daydream](https://vr.google.com/daydream/), and similar virtual 
reality devices. Be aware that the Vive and Rift do require some mighty
powerful desktop hardware to run.
2. You will also need a WebVR-capable browser. For the latest list of browsers
that support WebVR — as well as download and setup instructions — see 
[WebVR Rocks](https://webvr.rocks/).
3. Bring your senses of [curiosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiosity)
and [wonder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_(emotion)). VR is still new
and exciting — don’t become jaded. (Also, if the earth does not appear in your
VR goggles after clicking the “View in VR” button, try clicking it again to 
disengage, and then again to re-engage. Your pioneer spirit is appreciated!)


Run locally
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The simplest way to fire this up on your own desktop machine is to start a 
simple Python server. Open up a 
[command line prompt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface), 
navigate to wherever you’ve stored this code package, then type the 
following command depending on the version of 
[Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) you have
installed.  

Python 2: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`  
Python 3: `py -m http.server 8000`  

In your browser you can now navigate to http://localhost:8000/ to see 
[Day & Night ](https://dayandnight.moar.io "Day & Night (WebVR)") running 
locally. You can shutdown the local server by returning to the command line
and hitting Control + C.
